1. DO NOT send me a generic mail !! DO inform yourself about what I do, what I want and who I am.
2. DO NOT send me a mail without a clear object/title !! DO a clear object on the purpose of your mail : _CANDIDATE:RE:Front-end developer (ReactJS)_
3. DO NOT send me a mail with more than 250 words. DO it short (50-250 words). DO it concise. Use the present. And please, you are not Sheakspear. Stop trying.
4. DO NOT send me a mail without a clear and identified question. DO ask me something - but just one or two or three things. Not more ! Because, hey ! Why are you talking to me ? Why you need me ? But please, do it fast.
5. DO NOT send me a mail with faults. DO double, triple checks of your mail please. Basics dude, basics.
